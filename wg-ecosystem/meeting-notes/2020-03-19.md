# Ecosystem WG meeting 2020-03-19

Thursday, Mar 19, 2020 (9:00-10:00am PT)

## Attendees

* @erick
* @felix
* @hashimotoyt
* @kilian
* @malept
* @MarshallOfSound 

## Agenda

* Follow up from last meeting
  * WG access to electronjs.org analytics :heavy_check_mark: 
  * Curated Electron projects list
    * try to PR into awesome-electron first to remove any outdated links
  * docs feedback (loop/appzi)
    * accounts created, passwords need to go into 1password
* Signing docs outdated? (@malept)
  * https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/22656
* Key Result status updates
  * Increase adoption of Electron-provided tooling (@ckerr)
  * Increase views on /docs (@felix)
    * "in depth docs" - the easy instructions (e.g., "just use Electron Forge/Packager") gets overwhelmed by the manual instructions
      * the manual instructions are still helpful to have to show how things work
      * perhaps use `<details>` to initially "hide" the "here's how you would do it 'by hand'"
      * Downside: That tag has anecdotally strange a11y problems for a built-in tag

## Action Items

* @felix to look at the signing docs plus any others that he finds to be outdated
