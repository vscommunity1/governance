## Agenda:
1. Need to decide the following:
    * Rules for Joining QA WG
        * Willing to attend monthly QA WG meeting
        * Contribute to OKRs and Initiatives
    * Can non-members attend meetings?
        * Yes
        * If non-members are QA people, we encourage them to become members of this WG
    * Fill in initiatives with 1-2 paragraphs.
        * Done
2. Housekeeping checklist:
    * [x] Slack channel in ElectronHQ workspace
        * do we want to create a new channel or rename #electron-qa? note: #electron-qa includes members who are not in this WG
            * rename to #wg-qa (@maria)
    * [x] Slack user-group in ElectronHQ workspace
        * Yes use @qa-wg (@maria)
    * [x] GitHub team in Electron
        * Yes (@groundwater)
    * [x] add directory for wg-qa in [governance repo](https://github.com/electron/governance)
        * [x] add README in wg-qa directory
    * add wg-qa in top-level [README in governance repo](https://github.com/electron/governance/blob/master/README.md)
    * https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/162
        * I think this will auto-generate on the electronjs.org website
3. Find a new meeting time. Current meeting time (every other weds at 9:30am) conflicts with a meeting Maria and Marcel have
    * Keep every 4 weeks on Wed @9:30am-PST
