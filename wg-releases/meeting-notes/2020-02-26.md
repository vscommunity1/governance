## Agenda
* Automated patches
    * currently we manually remember to release
    * What if we had the bot trigger the on a schedule?
    * latest 3 stables (i.e., v 6, 7, 8, 9-beta)
    * Mondays and Thursdays
* Minor All The Things
    * We shouldn't be so limiting on minors and features, let's change the policy
    * If there are safe semver minor features that would like to be released in a minor version, we should release it 
    * For features that are considered stable, we should be able to land them more quickly
        * "Considered stable" means at least one PR approval. So a new feature could land at any time, excepting the "dead week" before stable, after consideration of two people (author and reviewer).
    * If there is disagreement in the review process in the PR on master, it would be brought to the API WG for discussion
    * **Pausing discussion to be continued in next week's meeting and async**
* Rotation responsible for investigating nightlies failures
    * There's sometimes a bystander effect when nightlies fail
    * Relatedly, we should change to weekday nightlies only
    * We should onboard more people to have experience with debugging, not just the people who have sudowoodo kick off access
        * Maybe have a hackmd of frequently-encountered problems
    * Current releasers: Sam, Shelley, John, Charles
    * Pair a new releaser with an experienced one
    * TODO: start by making a markdown table in hackmd for rotation
    * Group agreement in implementing rotation
