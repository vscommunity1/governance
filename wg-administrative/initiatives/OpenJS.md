# Consensus

The group must come to consensus before the final recommendation is made back to the Electron working groups.
We will strive for unanimous consensus, and failing that will look for majority plus chair.

# Removal

1. Individuals may voluntarily relinquish their membership.
2. If all other members vote to remove a member.

3. The chair can remove a member, but should provide an explaination to other members. (e.g. to alleviate a deadlock where we want to remove TWO inactive members)

# Addition
