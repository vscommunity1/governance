Date: March 2, 2020

## Attendees
**Members:**
 * Felix
 * Erick
 * Sam
 * David

## Agenda
* /r/electronjs ? (@erickzhao)
    * There is an unmoderatored Electron subreddit on Reddit, and since the main moderator was "out" for too long, Reddit locked the whole subreddit down. Sam put in a request to take over the subreddit. tl;dr: Done.
* OpenJS World Update (@erickzhao)
    * Erick has joined the program committee. The first meeting with him happened last week . Since it's JavaScript's "birthday", they'd like some interstitial videos (30s long) that have VIPs talk about how great JavaScript is.
    * There is another meeting this week going over the CfP.
* Case Studies (@felix)
    * Rachel has reached regarding Case Studies (for the OpenJS website, not for ours) and would like us to reach out to a few companies.
* Covalence 2021
